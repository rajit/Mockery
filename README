Mockery - a mock object framework for test-driven development in perl.

This code came about out of some frustration with the existing mocking systems
available in perl.  As easy as it is to play around with classes dynamically in
perl, creating mocks is quite a specialised task that, as witnessed by examples
in smalltalk and Java, benefits greatly from a suitably specialised tool.

This module uses the Module::Build system, so to build, test and install use the
following commands:

Build:
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build

Test:
    ./Build test

Install:
    ./Build install # probably needs sudo/root permissions
